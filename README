just some examples of models, controllers, one for cakephp and another one for laravel, inside of each project you can see some javascript examples, cakephp is based on old version of rotogrinders.com and laravel is based on chilibet777.com preditions site for CR professional soccer league, you could see rankings, and users scores on each game.

Inside Larave you can see routes and filters files also.

If you have some questions just tell me.
